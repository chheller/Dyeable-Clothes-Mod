# Dyeable-Clothes-Mod
A Forge mod for Minecraft 1.8 that creates non-leather, dyeable cloth armor
First mod, first readme so bear with me here
This mod introduces a single set of cloth armor made from wool in the normal armor crafting patterns. 
However, this armor is dyeable much like leather armor is in minecraft. Combine white wool in a crafting grid to get the clothes
then combine each piece with your desired dye to get a colored version. 

If you have any questions about the source code feel free to ask. So far as I know, this is the only complete code around that 
is functionally identical to leather dyeing.
